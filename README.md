This is totally random - This script does quick check for the external ssrf usng X-Forwarded-for , you can also abuse this to send thousands of requests against random servers in the infra either external or internal (depends).

Note - i'll add more headers as we improve.

```bash
python3 random_ssrf.py http://target id.collab.net '/endpoint'
```
