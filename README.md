# Header Abuse SSRF and AC bypass

This is totally random - This script does quick check for the external ssrf using X-Forwarded-for , you can also abuse this to send thousands of requests against random servers in the infra either external or internal (depends) as well as AC bypasses.

## Note - "I know there is plugin like this in for burp but this randomized uniq id in burp collab to avoid any issues and keep sending and hitting the target(s)".

you can also use 127.0.0.1 in place of id.collab.net to check for AC bypass.

## Usage  
```bash
python3 random_ssrf.py http://target id.collab.net '/endpoint'
```
